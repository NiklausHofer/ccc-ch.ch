# Contributors Policy

## Development / Branches

- The current code is always in the `master` branch.
- We never push directly to `master`. This is enforced by Gitlab.
- When changing something, always create a fork or a branch. Do your changes
  there and create a merge request against `master`.

## Review Policy

- Pull requests with content changes **must** be reviewed by another developer
  (4 eyes principle). The acceptance of the merge request must be done by commenting.
- Pull requests with minor changes or new press articles may be merged directly.

Thanks for any contributions!
